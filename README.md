# Image Inpainting Algorithms: FISTA, ISTA and BM3D Comparison

## 📋 Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation and experimental results for comparing FISTA (Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm), ISTA (Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm), and BM3D (Block-Matching and 3D filtering) algorithms for image inpainting tasks.
